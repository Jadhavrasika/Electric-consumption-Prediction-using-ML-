# Household Power Consumption Prediction
## Objective:
Building a Machine Learning Regression Model
The primary objective is to build a robust and accurate machine learning regression model that can predict future household power consumption based on historical data. This involves:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and potentially engineering new features (e.g., time-based features like hour of day, day of week). 
- Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting power consumption. This may involve analyzing correlations between variables and using feature importance techniques. 
- Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate regression model (e.g., linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, random forest, gradient boosting) based on the characteristics of the data and the desired level of accuracy.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Training the selected model on a portion of the data and evaluating its performance on a held-out test set using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
-  Model Optimization: Tuning the model's hyperparameters to improve its predictive accuracy and generalization performance.

## Conclusion:

- The project successfully predicted Household Power Consumption based on electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. Month ,Year,Day, and Submetering were found to be the most influential factors.
- The best-performing model can help several significant benefits, ultimately leading to better management and optimization of energy usage.
- It can provide tailored recommendations to individual households on how to reduce their energy consumption based on their specific usage patterns.
